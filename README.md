# Bi-Objective A* (BOA*)

This is the C implementation of Bi-Objective A*. BOA* computes a Pareto frontier containing paths from a given initial node to a given goal node on a given graph with two cost functions. More details in the following paper:

A Simple and Fast Bi-Objective Search Algorithm. ICAPS 2020: 143-151](https://ojs.aaai.org//index.php/ICAPS/article/view/6655)

The implementation contained in this package assumes the graph is explicitly given.

# Benchmark files

The map files are stored in a separate file that you can download [from here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n95JsiNVCwHpQvu9kWLAlPyOUFkw9_jP/view?usp=sharing).

# Compilation

Compile using `make`.

# Running BOA*

To run a single problem use  `./boastar [graph_file] [start_node] [goal_node]`. For example: `./boastar ./boastar Maps/NY-road-d.txt 1 500`.

# Running the Benchmarks

To run the benchmark problems, download and unzip the map files as indicated above. Then, run something like:

`sh script.sh Maps/NY-road-d.txt Queries/NY-queries`
